These materials are the product of a course in developing, implementing and testing algorithms. The course required two projects with a final examination. Interaction with the implemented algorithms is accomplished through terminal-based interfaces, which requires a secure implementation that guards against type errors.

**Examination**

The final examination consisted of five algorithm implementations, which were tested against a series of method calls with varying parameter values. The purpose of this format was to determine whether the student was able to interpret the requirement specification and accurately develop and safely implement the necessary algorithm.

**Project 1**

The first project required each student in the project group to develop and safely implement an algorithm. Each component of this project had to be combined into a main script, which enables users to call the implemented methods through a safe terminal-based interface. This meant that the project required coordination of method parameters and collaboration during development, as components depended on each other's output.

This project required us to implement a program that provided statistical analysis of a given dataset.

**Project 2**

The second project required each student in the project group to develop and safely implement an algorithm. Each component of this project had to be combined into a main script, which enables users to call the implemented methods through a safe terminal-based interface. This meant that the project required coordination of method parameters and collaboration during development, as components depended on each other's output.

This project required us to implement a program that would draw graphs based on the choice of algorithm and the given parameters.
